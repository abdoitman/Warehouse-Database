# Warehouse Database
## About The Project
The project aims to create a database for a warehouse that stores information about the customers, shelves & products, orders, and robots serving the warehouse. The database is designed to efficiently manage all the data related to the warehouse operations, including the inventory of products and the movement of goods from the time an order is placed until they are moved to the administrator booth.<br>

The database stores information about the customers, including their names, addresses, and contact details. The database also stores information about the shelves in the warehouse, including their location and the products that are stored on them. This information is used by the robots that serve the warehouse to locate products and transport them from the appropriate shelves to the administrator booth.
